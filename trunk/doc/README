BUILDING:
Requirements
bnfc
java 1.6

The rest is self-contained

./gencode
  Will generate the needed missing classes and run the makefile


Options:
Standard GNU command line behavior
    -w LEVEL    Can be used to print extra warnings (will make the testsuite fail)

Conflicts:
    Can't parse declarations like mytype[] a;
    To solve dot notations colliding between function calls in external modules and array's length,
    a single rule is used in both cases and then the parse tree is edited turning the function calls
    in the appropriate class.

Extensions:
    arrays1
    arrays2
    pointers
    modules
    C-like for loop, with break and continue (i sent an email to the prof about it)

Notes on language:
Expressions:
    a++ and the rest are expressions and return a value
    a=1 is an expression and returns a value

Loops:
    Foreach:
        for (int x:a)                       As requested by array extension, a is NOT saved in a temp var
    For:
        for (int a=0,b=1;a<max;b--,a++)
        for (a=0,b=1;d=a,a<max;b--,a++)
    While:
        do while
        while
    Other:
        break       exits the inner loop
        continue    continues with the next iteration of the inner loop skipping the rest
    
Array:
    a[1]++ works    (a must be int[], not covered in the testsuite)
    

Pointers:
    a->val++ works

Modules:
    The testsuite has a missing return statement
    To compile the non-main module i should disable the check on the presence of the main function, but then one of the bad tests would fail.
    Also making it generate one .ll file for each module would be possible, but then the linker should link all the files together.
