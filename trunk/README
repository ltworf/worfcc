BUILDING:
Requirements
bnfc
java 1.6

The rest is self-contained

./gencode
  Will generate the needed missing classes and run the makefile


Options:
Standard GNU command line behavior
    -w LEVEL    Can be used to print extra warnings (will make the testsuite fail)
    -O LEVEL    Optimization level, on LLVM target only enables or disables constant folding

Conflicts:
    Can't parse declarations like mytype[] a;

Notes on language:
Expressions:
    a++ and the rest are expressions and return a value
    a=1 is an expression and returns a value

Loops:
    Foreach:
        for (int x:a)                       As requested by array extension, a is NOT saved in a temp var
    For:
        for (int a=0,b=1;a<max;b--,a++)
        for (a=0,b=1;d=a,a<max;b--,a++)
    While:
        do while
        while
    Other:
        break       exits the inner loop
        continue    continues with the next iteration of the inner loop skipping the rest
    
Array:
    a[1]++ works    (a must be int[], not covered in the testsuite)
    
    ArrayB: Doesn't work on chalmers due to different arch, array003 works on my computer (x86_64) anyway

Pointers:
    a->val++ works
