The rest is self-contained

./gencode
  Will generate the needed missing classes and run the makefile
  
  
Notes:

Cycles:
    for (int x:a)
    a can be any expression returning a 1-dimension array, will be executed only once
    
    for (int a=0,b=1;a<max;b--,a++)
        
    do while
    while
    break
    continue
    
Array: a[1]++ works (not covered in the testsuite)
Expressions: a=b=1, a=b++; (not required)
